\chapter{Differential Equations}
This compendium is based on MIT OpenCourseWare ``Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler'' by Professor Gilbert Strang and Dr.~Cleve Moler in 2015.
I can not guarantee the accuracy of this compendium and that it is a correct interpretation of the material and explanation provided by the lecture notes and lectures. Thus, for accurate information refer to the material that this compendium is based on. If a mistake is in the compendium it is most likely my fault and not the fault of the material in which this compendium is based on.
