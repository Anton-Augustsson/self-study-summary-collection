% TODO: update programme summary so the gap is not to big
\chapter{Study Plan}
There are several course topics summarized in this document.
They are related in someways but can be regarded as isolated and there for have to correlation to between topics.
Each of the courses is summarized in each own chapter and is mostly based on a course from MIT, Yale, or Stanford.
MIT in particular has a great selection of open courses in various scientific topics. Each of the chapters starts
with a general info of the course it is based on and various relevant links for the course material.
The chapters are in chronological order the courses was taken and as no relation to topics.
