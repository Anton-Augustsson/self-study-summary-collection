\chapter{Physics II}
This compendium is based on the course notes of MIT 8.02 2004 \url{https://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www/802TEAL3D/visualizations/coursenotes/index.htm} and the lectures of MIT 8.02 by Professor Walter Lewin in 2002. The vedio lectures can be viewed on YouTube from Lectures by ``Walter Lewin. They will make you \ensuremath\varheartsuit~Physics.'' with the playlist name ``8.02x - MIT Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism''
All credits go to Dr. Sen-ben Liao, Dr. Peter Dourmashkin, and Professor John W. Belcher at MIT for the lecture notes and Professor Walter Lewin for the inspiring lectures. I can not guarantee the accuracy of this compendium and that it is a correct interpretation of the material and explanation provided by the lecture notes and lectures. Thus, for accurate information refer to the material that this compendium is based on. If a mistake is in the compendium it is most likely my fault and not the fault of the material in which this compendium is based on.
