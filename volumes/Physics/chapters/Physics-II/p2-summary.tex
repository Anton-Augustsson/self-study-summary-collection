%\section{Introduction}
\section{Electric Charges}
%\section{Electric Charges and Forces and Coulomb's Law - Polarization}
An atom comprises positively charged protons, neutrally charged neutrons, and negatively charged electron.
An atom or molecule can have a neutral, positive or negative electric charge. A negatively charged atom or molecule is called a \textit{negative ion}, meaning to a surplus of electrons compared to protons.
A positively charged atom or molecule is called a \textit{positive ion}.
The nucleus, the protons and neutrons or the atom, is significantly larger than an electron, a proton with a size of $10^{-15}\SI{}{\meter}$ is roughly 1000 times larger than an electron with a size of $10^{-18}\SI{}{\meter}$.
For a hydrogen atom the lower energy state has the most probable distance, using Bohr Radius, of approximately $10^{-11}\SI{}{\meter}$ from the nucleus, which is 10000 times further than the size of the hydrogens' proton.

An intuitive way of thinking why same changed ions repel each other and why opposite charged ions attracted each other is to think about a room where we have loud and talkative people who want someone to listen to them, i.e., negative ions, and quiet, shy listeners, positive ions. When a loud and talkative person is approached by another loud and talkative person they talk over each other and neither gets want they want and find it physically uncomfortable to be near each other, they naturally repel each other. Likewise, if two quite people talk to each other they find it awkward and physically uncomfortable to be close each other. However, if there are a quite, shy listener and a loud talkative person they have found there mach.

Conductors allows electrons to flow ``freely'', there is always some resistance. Continuing with our metaphor we can think of it as a channel where the voice of the loud and talkative person can travel far and reach the quite, shy listener. And non-conductors are like a wall where the voice does not travel through.

\section{Polarization}

If we have a positive charge object like we see with the rod in Figure~\ref{fig:charged-rod} placed next to a conductive object like we see with the cloud shaped object next to the rod, the conductive object will have a negative and a positive charged side. Only $10^{13}$ of electrons that was originally on the left side might have moves to the right side.

What happens in Figure~\ref{fig:charged-rod} mostly due to induction where the atoms become polarized, i.e., the electron spends more time on one side than the other.

\section{Electric Forces and Coulomb's Law}
%31:50 Coulomb's Law 
%40:00 what holds the world together, the autom scale the neculer force, then the electric force and on the size of planets and galixies it is the gravitational force. why
Coulomb's law describes the force resulted by two charged points $q_1$ and $q_2$, seperated by a distance $r$ in vacuum.
\begin{equation}
  \vec{\boldsymbol{F}}_{12} = k_e \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}
\end{equation}
where $k_e$ is Coulomb's constant. $\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}$ is the unit vector derected from $q_1$ and $q_2$ defined as $\hat{\boldsymbol{r}}=\vec{\boldsymbol{r}}/r$.
See Figure~\ref{fig:coulomb-illustration} for the illustration of Coulomb's law.

Coulomb's constant $k_e$ is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
  k_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} = \SI[per-mode = fraction]{8.9875e9}{\newton\meter\squared\per\coulomb\squared}
\end{equation*}
where $\varepsilon_0$ is the \textbf{Vacuum Permittivity}, also known as the \textbf{Electric Constant} or the \textbf{Permittivity of Free Space}, i.e., a measure of how much resistance the vacuum of empty space puts up against an electric field.
\begin{equation*}
  \varepsilon_0 = \SI[per-mode = fraction]{8.85e-12}{\coulomb\squared\per\newton\meter\squared}
\end{equation*}
