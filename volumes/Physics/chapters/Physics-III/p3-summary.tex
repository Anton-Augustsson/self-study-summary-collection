\chapter{Physics III}
This compendium is based on MIT OpenCourseWare course ``Physics III: Vibrations and Waves'' in the fall of 2016 by Professor Yen-Jie Lee. All credits go to MIT OpenCourseWare and the excellent Professor Yen-Jie Lee.
The compendium is my interpretation of the course material, and it is fully possible that the compendium contains mistakes. For correct information refer to the course material instead.
