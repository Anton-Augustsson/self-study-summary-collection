\chapter{Hydraulics}
This compendium on hydraulics is based on Jim Pytel excellent course called ``Hydraulics Training'' on YouTube. I highly recommend viewing it, its also more correct than what is written in this compendium since Mr. Pytel is much more knowledgeable about Hydraulics than me. Additional, Yuken Kogyo Co.,LTD has an great book on hydraulics~\cite{yuken2006basic}.


\section{Introduction and Fluid Properties}
Hydraulics systems transfer power by fluid within a close system. The advantage over pneumatic systems, which uses air, is that most fluids are incompressible, resulting in the ability of hydraulic actuators, e.g., hydraulic cylinder, to hold its position even under high loads. 

% Compressability
A substance's resistance to uniform compression is measured in terms of Bulk modulus ($B$), $B = \Delta{P}/(\Delta{V}/V)$, where $P$ is pressure and $V$ is volume. For water the bulk modulus is 2190 MPa~\cite{brennen_fluid_dynamics} in 20 C and in typical heavy machinery application the pressure is between 20–35 MPa, meaning that the volume will only decrease about 9-15.9 mL for each liter of water. Water is typically not used in hydronic systems, instead mineral-based hydraulic oil that are derived from crude oil or synthetic-based hydraulic oil, which have a slightly lower bulk module. But even for high pressure systems 50 MPa under 20 C the bulk modulus is 1880 MPa~\cite{gholizadeh_fluid_bulk_modulus}, resulting a volume decrease of....  Temperature has a greater effect on volume, however, both need to be taken into account.

% Lubricant
Mineral-based and synthetic-based hydronic oil has additional properties over water, it acts as a lubricant. It also provides a seal for hydraulic cylinders, unlike water that could leak between chambers?

% Viscosity
Another properties...


% Oil and no other fluid since its a lubricant.
% What is it good for, much stronger and can keep its position. Fluids are not compressable.
% Very basic about the varius components


\section{Pascals Law with Examples for Hydraulic Systems}
\subsection{Pascals Law}
A pressurized static fluid in a closed vessel exerts pressure equally in all direction throughout the fluid and works octagonal on a plane. Pressure ($P$ [$Pa$ or $psi$]) can be expressed  as a fraction of the force ($F$ [$Nm$ or $lbf$]) per unit area ($A$ [$m^2$ or $in^2$]). 
\begin{equation*}
  P = \frac{F}{A}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Force Multiplier}
A small weight providing small force can lift a large weight requiring large force.
